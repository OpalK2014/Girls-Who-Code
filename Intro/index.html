          To Make Minecraft Cool
        </h1>
        <p>
         Vanilla Minecraft can be boring after a long, long, while playing with your friends, servers, or playing and surviving alone. Here are some tips to brighten and make your Minecraft more interesting.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Mods!
        </h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Most mods add content to the game to alter gameplay, change the creative feel, or give the player more options in how they interact with the Minecraft world. Most people who create mods for Minecraft (known as modders) use Minecraft Coder Pack and either ModLoader or Minecraft Forge to do so. Some mods may be bigger expansions, others add more settings and options to optimize speed, graphics, or gameplay of the game. Server mods or plugins mainly give server admins more options and ease of use, and most mods for single-player have a server version that allows or optimizes the mod in multiplayer.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Mods</h2>
        <h3>
          Client-Based
        </h3>
        <p>
          Client mods are modifications to your game files themselves. They are not custom clients, and they require modification of minecraft.jar.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the Minecraft server software will ignore custom content from client side, most of the client mods which add new content to the game do not work in SMP unless a modification has also been installed on the server. Some authors of client mods have made server versions of their mods available, and others have not. A few of the Loader/API type client mods (e.g. ModLoader and AudioMod) and many of the functional client mods (e.g. Optifine, Rei's Minimap and TooManyItems) have effect in SMP straight away, without any modification on server side.

        <h3>
          Server-Based
        </h3>
        <p>
          Server mods are modifications to the official Minecraft server software. They are commonly designed to make administration of servers easier by implementing tiered privileges for commands (such as kicking, banning etc.). They are frequently implemented as "wrappers" which do not actually modify the main server .jar file, instead monitoring its output and sending commands to it.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Mod Packs
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mod packs are collections of mods that have been put together and configured so that they will all work together. Mod packs are often centered around a general theme like tech, quests, or magic. Mod packs often have either custom launchers or installers that make installing and running the mod pack easy. Some of the more popular mod packs are Feed The Beast, Tekkit and Hexxit. There are of course also smaller mod packs, such as Crafting Dead and Blocklaunch, most of which using the special Minecraft Technic Launcher from Technic Pack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most mod packs can be found on custom launchers, which make it easy to install and launch various mod packs.The most popular of these are the Technic, Feed the Beast, ATlauncher, and the new Curse.com client launchers. In addition to making it easy to install mod pack clients, certain launchers can also download mod pack servers.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Bugs
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you install a mod, it may stop the game from working properly. If you encounter a problem while using mods and want to report it, first remove all of your mods and see if the problem still happens. If the problem continues to happen, it can be reported on the bug tracker. Otherwise, try to reproduce the problem with the fewest possible number of mods, and then report the problem to the author(s) of those mods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Minecraft crashes, a modified game is flagged in the crash report. The following link explains how to obtain a crash report. (Note: If your Minecraft has never crashed, following those instructions won't find anything.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The code that checks for mods is fairly simple, and it's not always correct; it may say 'probably not' even with mods installed. However, it's very difficult to get the 'very likely' message if you haven't modified minecraft.jar somehow, so that's essentially a 'yes'. There's also a 'definitely' message, seen when a Bukkit server crashes and under other similar circumstances, like when the Minecraft Forge API is installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Probably not' appears when the client/server brand appears to the in-game check to be unaltered (often termed 'vanilla') and the META-INF folder is still there. 'Very likely' appears when the META-INF folder is not present but the client/server brand seems to be vanilla. 'Definitely' plus the client name appears when the client is not vanilla. For example, you might see something like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            Is Modded: Definitely: Client brand changed to 'fml,forge'
          </i>
        </p>
        <h2>
          Caution about using Mods in Minecraft
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before you decide to mod (modify) your copy of Minecraft, it is very important to understand what you are doing or you may end up messing up your copy. (If your copy of Minecraft is compromised, you can always backup your worlds and re-download Minecraft) Let me repeat that for you: If you mod Minecraft, you may break your copy of the game as well as any worlds that you play in. Because you are doing something that is wholly unsupported by Mojang, they won't be able to help you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to how modding works, updating the Minecraft client will break your mods. That is, with each update of the Minecraft client, you will have to obtain updated mods and re-install them. However, the worlds you created will not be destroyed (although any mod items in your world will not be present).
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the authors of the mod make no guarantees as to whether or not the code works, much less any guarantees of support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly all mod packs have auto-installers that make adding mods to Minecraft extremely easy for the beginner Modder.
        </p>
       <h2>
         Installing Mods prerequisites
        </h2>
        <li>
          Knowledge of Zipping/Unzipping files, and working with a good archive utility (such as WinRAR, 7zip, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing how to submit proper bug reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing how to actually install the mod and its prerequisites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing how to accurately read and follow instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knowing which mods conflict with each other and which do not.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making sure you reread the instructions.
        </li>
        <p>
          You might be able to get away without knowing how to do a few of these things, but if your copy of Minecraft breaks, then you should seek help from somebody in the modding community (preferably the mod author). If you view this as a great opportunity to learn something new, then you're on the right path!
        </p>
        <p>
          note: You can use MCPatcher to do some or all of this work for you!

        <h2>
          How Mods Work
        </h2>
        <p>
          A file on your computer called "minecraft.jar" provides everything Minecraft needs to be able to run. For example: world generation, showing blocks, managing mobs, items, and recipes. When you add mods to Minecraft, you are taking Minecraft.jar and over-writing it with the changes needed. All of these files inside of minecraft.jar that make it run are run through a process called "obfuscation". Basically what that means is that it changes words like "recipe" to words like "bf" (for the technically minded, all class names, variable names and identifiers are turned into one to three letter nonsense names).
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, each entity in the game (a Mob, Item, Block, etc.) has an ID so they can be described on the map. As new content is added to Minecraft, new IDs are used.

          This has a few very important implications:
        </p>
        <li>
          This is fundamentally changing the way Minecraft was meant to be played. So Mojang will not be able to help you in any way, and are not responsible for crashes, data loss, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some mods might claim to do something like add a cute puppy to your world, but could in fact have been authored with a malicious intent such as stealing your Minecraft username/password, or install a keylogger. This is only a concern if…
        <ul>
          The mod that you download contains an executable and you run it.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The mod that you download informs you that you should modify the Minecraft launcher
        </ul>
        </li>
        <p>
          (Minecraft.jar generally in the main application directory; not the 'minecraft.jar' described below. If the mod that you wish to install involves neither of these actions then you should feel quite secure. If not, a good measure of safety is to only install very popular mods. Risugami created the Modloader and other great, safe, and popular mods; and the new version made modding much more safe. Read comments on mod posts before downloading and installing)
        </p>
        <li>
          When Minecraft is updated, all mods need to be re-updated by their authors and sometimes need to be re-downloaded and placed into the folder, you may also need to download the latest version of mod loader, because Mojang obfuscates the source of the mod when minecraft updates. If a mod uses an ID number that Mojang chooses to use in the update, this will cause further issues, and your world will look weird, or potentially be completely broken and unusable. Mod authors do this of their own free will, and it can take weeks for them to update. However, this doesn't mean you should harass the author about it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If two mods do similar things, they will likely be incompatible, because they both will try to change the "bf" (or "recipe") file. (This can be fixed, nowadays mods also come with a properties file to change block and item ID's to fix conflicts.)
        </li>
        <li>
          You may be adding new entities to your worlds, so if you ever have to remove the mods (say because of a Minecraft update), that world will no longer be compatible.
        </li>
        <h2>
          Downloading Mods
        </h2>
        <p>
        The best place for a list to download mods is on the Wiki's mods page. It is a reliable place to find mods and it is updated frequently. Alternatively, mods can be found on the Minecraft Forum's Mods section. Note that this section has in excess of almost 600 pages so it can be tedious to find a mod that you're looking for or good mods.
