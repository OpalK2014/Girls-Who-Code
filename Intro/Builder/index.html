     For most people who start Minecraft, they usually want to build. As they always go through survival, players go through rough work and patience to design as well as get resources for building. But how exactly do you become a master builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, this website can't realy help you with that, but here are some tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start building in creative before you try building in survival. You can build worlds in creative too, but building in survival give more of an achievement or award.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try and add as much detail in one project. Experiment with your design. Symmetrical is good, but let nature take place. Build with the terrain, not around.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's all that I can say!

      So, what is the difference?

      Blocks and their textures

     <p>
      Textures can vary in various building projects, possibly rainbows made from wool, but as you can tell, a rainbow made of colored glass looks much better, as quartz slabs prove a much smoother and clean surface than quartz blocks, it is best to look at all of the blocks before building. A good place to start if you want to build a magnificent world with amazing builds, is to set all of the blocks in Minecraft, either in survival or creative. This creates a sense of what fits best in your build. Another thing to figure out is the special abilities of each block. For example, some blocks can glow, and netherrack can prove to  be a better source for fire rather than traditional oak wood. Redstone torches could be turned off. Another note, in fact, is to know how most redstone contractions work in order to make a successful redstone build.
